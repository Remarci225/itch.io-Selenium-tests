# itch.io-Selenium-tests
Implementing Selenium tests in Java for [itch.io](https://itch.io/)

**Important**: make sure that you either...
1. change `CONFIGURATION_PATH` in `BasePage.java` to use `development.txt` instead of `production.txt` and update the
username and password in that file, or...
2. add `production.txt` next to `development.txt` and fill it out in a similar way.
